ADDED FILES: smoketest.sh (a shell script utilized in the check target of the Makefile to run tests)

There are 6 test cases that are tested in the smoketest shell script. 

Cases 1-4 are checked alone and also amongst correct flags to see if it 
makes a difference. 

1A/B: Tests if invalid argument return exit code 1.
2A/B: Tests if invalid input files return exit code 2.
3A/B: Tests if invalid output files return exit code 3.
4A/B: Tests if the segmentation fault is caught and returns exit code 4.
5A/B: First tests if exit code is 0 for no errors and if the two files are
the same.
6A/B: Tests if the appropriate exit code is returned when both the input
and output files will cause errors. It checks to see if the first error
on the command line is the one returned. So if the --input flag is first
then error code should be 2.
