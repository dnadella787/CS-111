lab4b.c - implements temperature logging (in F or C) at a given interval. 
		  The output log can also be appended to an actual file using the 
		  --log=filename option. Other options that are included are --scale=C (or F)
		  and --period=number.The program also accepts commands via stdin that all 
		  do various things such as:
		  	- SCALE=F -- changes temperature logging to Fahrenheit
			- SCALE=C -- changes temperature logging to Celcius
			- PERIOD=seconds -- change the interval
			- STOP -- program stops
			- START -- resume generating reports (given it stopped)
			- LOG lineoftext -- simply log LOG lineoftext to stdin/filename
			- OFF -- stops the program completely and exits
		In addition it takes a button input that will also act as the OFF
		command.
