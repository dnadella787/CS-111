Tarball contains two C source modules. The first, lab1b-client.c, creates a client 
and takes in input from the keyboard and forwards it via a network socket to a 
server program, lab1b-server.c, which then forwards it a shell child process that 
is created via a fork. The shell then sends the output of commands back to the server
which are then sent back to the client and displayed. 

There is an optional --compress flag that makes all communication across the network 
socket be via compressed data. 

A makefile is also included that has a default target that produces both the client
and server program. It also has individual targets for the two programs, a clean 
target to return the directory to an untarred state, and a dist target to produce
the distribution tarball.
