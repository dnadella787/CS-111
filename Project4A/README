my_beaglebone.jpg: selfie with me and the beaglebone

connected.jpg: screenshot of me using PuTTY to access the Beaglebonem which was
connected to my laptop via the provided USB mini to USB 3.0 cable. I also changed
the name according to the tutorial given in the spec and then rebooted the device
to make the name show accordingly. Although, I was not able to get the full name 
of 205150584.lasr.cs.ucla.edu to show; I could only get my UID to show, hence the 
debian@205150583 for the terminal prompt. It also shows the output of running ifconfig.

copy.png: screenshot of me using scp command to move a simple hello world program,
called hw.c, to the beaglebone. From here on out I used WSL on my windows machine 
to SSH into the Beaglebone over wifi. I also tested out FileZilla as per the tutorial
given in the spec but preferred using WinSCP since I have been using it since 35L. It
also supports the SFTP option. 

build_run.png: screenshot of me building the hw.c using gcc into the executable hw 
and then running it. I then ran it and it outputted "hello world" 

git.png: screenshot of me cloning my own git repo to the Beaglebone. The repo I 
cloned was called Argparser-for-CPP. I did not have to use apt-get to install git
as it was already on my Beaglebone. Thus, I did not include me downloading it in 
the screenshot.
